## ‚ö° Quick Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wesleykyle2005/Network-web50
   cd network
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. (Optional) Populate the database for testing:
   ```bash
   python insertions.py
   ```
   This will create users, posts, likes, and random follow relationships for testing and demonstration.

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the application from your browser at:
